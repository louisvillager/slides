# Slides 'n Scrolls
## Marc Rivers

This project is designed for me to work on design aspects of a website, including:
- Image slideshows (a.k.a., carousels)
- Visual feedback on where on the page the user currently is ("scrollspy")

This was achieved primarily through Bootstrap and some minimal custom CSS.

***Note: this is still a work in progress!*** <br>
(January 2020) The responsive design is still in the works. The next phase of this project will be to make the
image carousels resize on smaller screens. This would also involve stylistic changes to the navbar.

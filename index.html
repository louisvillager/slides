        In this experiment, I try my hand at image slideshows (or carousels, if you
        prefer) and navigation UI that lets you know what part of the page you're actively
        on. And rather than bore you with "lorem ipsum" ad nauseam, I thought I'd offer
        my thoughts on various Akira Kurosawa samurai films. So, enjoy.

        "Rashomon" has such a clever storytelling technique, it inspired its own name
        for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashomon_effect" target="_blank">
          psychological effect
        </a>. It employs not one, but <i>four</i> unreliable narrators
        recounting the murder of a samurai by a simple roadside bandit. Each version
        is full of details that seem clearly embellished, but also some that are quite
        plausible. In the end, the viewer is left with ambiguity, allowing them to
        choose the most correct version for themselves.

        This is Kurosawa's magnum opus, a 3-hour-long (yup) paragon of the samurai
        genre. Perhaps you've seen the western <s>ripoff</s> remake, "The Magnificent
        Seven". (The first one, with Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen. I can't vouch
        for the new one with Denzel and Andy from "Parks and Recreation".)
      </p>
      <p>
        In this tale, a poor farming village under the thumb of bandits acts on an
        ambitious plan of liberation by hiring samurai to defeat their oppressors.
        Those warriors who answer the call range from a seasoned and wise samurai,
        to a starry-eyed neophyte, and even an illiterate thief who happens to more
        or less be good with a blade, to name a few. The epic struggle shows these
        samurai, would-be samurai, and farmers using every means they can they can
        think of to free their village from the more numerous and better-equipped
        bandits.

        Have you ever watched Macbeth and thought, "Sure, it's compelling, but I
        wonder how it would look when told through the lens of traditional Japanese
        Noh theater"? Well, good news! Kurosawa has just the movie for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, it's pretty much Macbeth. Taketoki Washizu receives a prophecy from
        a witch foretelling his rise to power. Before long, he becomes obsessed with
        this prophecy and the pursuit of power for power's sake, driving him and his
        wife, the Lady Asaji Washizu, to ever-greater lengths (and depths) to attain
        it. However, they both learn the true cost of ambition in the end.

      <p>
        "The Hidden Fortress" is the story of a princess and her bodyguard/general
        who must sneak across enemy lines to the safety of a neighboring kingdom.
        They recruit the help of two peasant soldiers who are more motivated by the
        promise of a large reward of gold than any greater struggle.
      </p>
      <p>
        This movie may be perhaps best known as one of the biggest inspirations for
        "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope". George Lucas particularly singled out
        how the story was told not through the perspective of the princess or her
        general, but rather "through the eyes of two lesser characters"&mdash;in this
        case, the two peasants.

      <p>
        My personal favorite, and yes, I will be obnoxious and use the correct Japanese
        spelling of Yoji<em>n</em>bo and not Yoji<em>m</em>bo. I don't care what the
        official title is. The "m" is a vestige of an outdated style of Romanizing Japanese
        words.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yojinbo" is the story of a nameless ronin who frees a town from two rival
        warlords by tricking them into fighting each other. You may have already seen
        the Sergio Leone western remake, "A Fistfull of Dollars", starring Clint Eastwood.
        "Yojinbo" has clever humor and interesting characters, and it features a hero
        who relies on his wit far more than his sword. If you're looking to try your
        first samurai film, I highly recommend starting here.

      <p>
        The unofficial sequel, of sorts, to "Yojinbo", "Sanjuro" follows the same
        character from the previous film as he thwarts a corrupt clan superintendent
        from framing a rival for his own abuses. Just as in the other film, he relies
        on outwitting the more numerous foe, with a fair bit of humor along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Truth be told, this is the movie on this list that I remember the least
        about. I had to reference IMDb for the particulars of the plot. It's not
        a bad film by any means, but the other entrants on this list are just that
        much more memorable. (Oddly, despite "Sanjuro" functioning as the sequel
        to "Yojinbo", Tatsuya Nakadai is in both films, playing different characters,
        each one of whom dies in their respective movies.)
